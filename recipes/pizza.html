    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <ol>

    
    <li>Prepare the dough
        <p>In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.
            In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil.
            Mix until a dough forms. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.
            Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours or until it doubles in size.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Prepare the sauce
        <p>In a saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute.
            Add the tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 10-15 minutes until the sauce thickens slightly. Set aside to cool</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        Peheat the oven.
        <p>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up</p>
    </li>

    <li>Assemble the pizza
        <p>Punch down the risen dough and divide it into two equal parts. Roll each part into a ball.
            On a floured surface, roll out one dough ball into a 12-inch circle. Transfer the rolled dough to a pizza peel or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
            Spread half of the sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.
            Sprinkle 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce and add your desired toppings</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        Bake the pizza
        <p>Carefully slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or place the baking sheet in the oven.
            Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
            Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Serve
        <p>Slice and serve hot. Enjoy your homemade pizza!</p>
