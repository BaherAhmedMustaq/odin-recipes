    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>

        <li>Prepare the cake
            <p>
                Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.
                In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.
                In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in the vanilla.
                Add the flour mixture alternately with the milk, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Mix until just combined.
                Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans and smooth the tops.
            </p>
        </li>
        

        <li>
            Bake the cake
            <p>
                Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
                Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then turn out onto wire racks to cool completely.

            </p>
        </li>
        

        <li>
            Prepare the frosting
            <p>
                In a large bowl, beat the butter until creamy. Gradually add the powdered sugar, beating until smooth.
                Add the heavy cream, vanilla extract, and salt. Beat on high speed for 3-4 minutes until light and fluffy.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            Assemble the cake
            <p>
                Place one cake layer on a serving plate. Spread a layer of frosting on top.
                Place the second cake layer on top and frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining frosting.
                Decorate as desired and serve.
